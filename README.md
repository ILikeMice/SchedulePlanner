# SchedulePlanner (WIP!!!)

A simple webuntis-themed Planner I made to help me plan my days! Please note that this is still a Work In Progress, since I didn't have enough time to fully finish it before the end of High Seas (I will continue working on it after highseas though!!!)

## Features

- Create Events for each Day
- Customize the color of the events and their Names
- Drag the little line at the bottom of each event to resize said Events!
- Scale the day for more precise resizing!
- More coming soon!

### Update 1

First update after release!

- Added line that follows current time
- Added ability to specify end time when creating event
- Polished the project overall!

## Future Features

Some things im planning on adding are:

- Dragging events within the day (maybe even between days!)
- Set time when creating event
- Change time precisely
- Edit Events more precisely
- Notifications as reminder about upcoming event(s)
